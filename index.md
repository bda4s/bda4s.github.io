## Big Data Analytics for Sustainability (BDA4S) 2023 

![Branching](figures/data-equipment.jpg)

### A Workshop at 2023 IEEE International Conference on Big Data [(IEEE Big Data 2023)](http://bigdataieee.org/BigData2023/)
December 15th - 18th, 2023, Sorrento, Italy

## Outline

Sustainability is a significant challenge, given the impending consequences of global warming. Computing has a crucial role to play in ensuring that we develop sustainable interactions with our environment and tackling the challenges associated with mitigating climate change. Big Data is a key asset in developing a more sustainable environment and can lead to new breakthroughs and better use of the resources we have. However, computing can be seen as part of the solution, as we use computational resources to make the world a more sustainable place, but also part of the problem â€“ with ICT accounting for 1.11Gt of CO2 in 2020 and estimated to more than double by 2030.

This workshop will focus on the cutting-edge developments from both academia and industry, with a particular emphasis on novel techniques to capture, store and process big data from a wide range of sources for improving sustainability, and in particular on the methodologies and technologies which can be applied to correlate, learn and mine, interpret and visualise data which will lead to a more healthy, and sustainable, interactions with the environment.
 
This workshop is timely and interesting for researchers, academics and practitioners in big data processing and analytics, energy efficiency, sustainability, and Green Computing. The workshop is very relevant to the big data community, especially data mining, machine learning, cyber-physical systems, and computational intelligence. It will bring forth a lively forum on this exciting and challenging area at the conference.
